# Shopify's Image Repository Marketplace 
Simple Java App that simulates an image marketplace where Photographers (sellers) sell images to Shopify Merchants (buyers), ultimately simulating Shopify's Burst Platform.

## Technologies Used
-> IDE: Apache NetBeans IDE 12.2
-> Language: Java
-> UI Designer: Scene Builder
-> Key Library: JavaFX

## How to Run
1) Clone/download repository
2) Open Project (preferably with NetBeans)
3) Run Server.java (found in the Server folder)
4) Once server is running, run the project (run button in top navigation bar)

## Simulation Recommendation
After running one instance of the Java app, click Run Project again to have a second instance. This way you will be able to simulate the buyer and seller experience side by side.
